When starting a data science project, it is often the case that one immediately starts experimenting with complex algorithms to arrive at a solution as quickly as possible, without having gained a clear understanding on the data first. In a number of cases, this leads to costly investments or flawed models because one started from the wrong assumptions, which donâ€™t seem to hold in practice.

Therefore, at the start of the data science process, it is important to gain a clear understanding about the data one is analysing. This data exploration phase eventually will allow you to derive viable working hypotheses related to the problem at hand, useful for the further analysis and modeling of the data. It will also help you to point out which data quality issues your dataset may have and which actions you should undertake to mitigate them. Throughout this process, you will be faced with different types of variables, often with complex interactions between them, which require different types of treatment.
In this Starter Kit you will learn how you can effectively explore your data and extract a set of working hypotheses that are valuable to examine throughout the subsequent data analysis.
