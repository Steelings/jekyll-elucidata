Estimating the remaining useful lifetime of an asset can be beneficial for several purposes in a variety of industrial contexts. For one, it can offer support in the better scheduling of maintenance operations, for example for offshore wind turbines. For such assets, maintenance can only be performed under the right weather conditions.
But also for other assets, maintenance is an important part of its lifecycle. Traditionally, maintenance is done in a corrective way, such that it is performed at the moment an asset has failed. In that case, the failing part is identified and rectified or replaced, to ensure that the asset can subsequently resume normal operation.
Especially for strongly interdependent production lines or industrial assets operating in critical environments, an unplanned downtime is to be avoided and often costly. For this reason, more recently, for an increasing number of assets preventive maintenance is performed. In that case, maintenance tasks are scheduled at regular intervals, avoiding future asset failure to a maximum extent â€“ but with the risk to replace assets that are still working correctly and still could for a while. Hence, the optimal time for replacement is wanted: The time when the asset still works correctly but will probably fail soon. And this is where the remaining useful lifetime comes into play.
